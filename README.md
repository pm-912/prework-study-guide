# Bootcamp Study Guide

## Description

Here is my first project in coding, a study guide on the basics of using HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. The study guide is designed to be an easily formatted and navigatible site where one can review the subjects dealt with in the prework modules for this bootcamp. It is a useful as a quick reference sheet, and in making it I learned a lot of the basics of coding.

## Usage

The study guide is intended to be a quick reference guide on the fundamentals of the four languages noted in the Descriptions.
